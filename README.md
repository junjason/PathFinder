# Background

A pathfinding, interactive demo that allows you to place start and end nodes on a matrix-grid
and use different algorithms to find a path from the start to the end node.

# Functionality & MVPs

In PathFinder, users will be able to:

 - Place start and end nodes
 - Place walls
 - Select a pathfinding algorithm (BFS, DFS, or Dijkstra's Algorithm)
 - Clear the grid and start over

In addition, this project will include:

 - Select the speed of the visualization
 - Add additional floors and elevators
 - To select between a weighted or unweighted graph

# Technologies, Libraries, APIs

No additional libraries or APIs will be used for this project. 

# Implementation Timeline

Friday Afternoon & Weekend - Implement grid and setting up the board with start node, end node and walls.
Also include option to add more floors (max 3) and elevators nodes. Implement clearing/resetting the board and basic nav-header menu.

Monday - Implement logic of BFS, DFS, and Dijkstra's.

Tuesday - Implement visualization of visited nodes (and speed options), back-tracing path, and finally
the path from start to finish.

Wednesday - Implement landing page + implement areas that needs to be worked on.

Thursday Morning - Continue implementing areas that need to be worked on.

(If additional time): Implement a weighted graph and visualize Dijkstra's Algorithm.
